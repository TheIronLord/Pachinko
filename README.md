# Pachinko
Players in this game click the edit button to add rectangle bars to the screen. Once they are done they try to destroy all the rectangle bars with five balls. They also have to get the ball in the green slot to gain points. Every ball that lands in a green slot is one point and every ball that lands in a red slot is minus one point.
